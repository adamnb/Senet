# Senet
Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game. I thought it would be interesting to make a version of it for my AP CS-A final. 
## Rules
Due to information being lost over thousands of years, there is no certain ruleset for Senet. However, the rules that I have implemented are straightforward and are as follows
### Setup
The game is played on a board with three rows of ten. The number of rows can be changed to range from 2 to 10 rows. When this board is drawn onto the screen, each slot is numbered.  

Both player gets their own set of 5 pawns that occupy a single slot. These are represented by a specific character (`@` and `#`by default). At the start of the game they occupy the first row and alternate from left to right.
